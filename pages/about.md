👋Hello, my name is **`Mahadev Reddy`** and I am a **`self-taught programmer`** .I am an 👨‍🎓undergraduate studying `B.Tech  in Electronics and Communications Engineering`. Even though I am a ECE student, My passion for  👨‍💻 computers have led me to expand my knowledge in `computer science` because I find it fascinating. From a young age, I was totally attracted by computer games which later develop into an interest for programming. I spend lots of time on the computer researching new developments in the IT industry and reading articles related to programming. I am very `enthusiastic` and `😎confident` with regards to anything involving computer systems, and I feel that this will play a major part in helping me expand my knowledge in this field, gaining exposure to new areas of computer science that I have not yet studied. I have been coding for a while, and I learned and accomplished a lot.

Apart from the academics 📚, I also aim to become a more independent person and make new friends with similar interests. I am hard working, responsible, ambitious, enthusiastic, independent and friendly. I enjoy helping people and to share my opinions and ideas with other students.

#### `Hobbies`:
* 🙇‍♂️ Reading books and articles related to tech.
* ⚽ Watching Football.
* 📝 I write articles here about the things I'm interested in.
