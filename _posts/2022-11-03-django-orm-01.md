In this first article about Django-orm, I will discuss how to retrieve model objects using Django-orm.
<!--more-->
## Create a Django model.

```python
from django.db import models
class Player(models.Model):
    name=models.CharField(max_length=50)
    team=models.CharField(max_length=50)
    nation=models.CharField(max_length=50)
```
- After creating a Django model Player in models.py file, run ```python manage.py makemigrations``` this command will generate a migration file in the migrations folder. Then, run ```python manage.py migrate``` this command will create a table with fields name, team and nation in the database.

- To interact with a Django application through a shell, run the command```python manage.py shell``` 

### To retrieve every entity in the Player table.
```python
from app_name.models import Player
players = Player.objects.all() # this method returns queryset
```
- Here ```objects``` is a model manager which acts as a interface to the database.

### To retrieve entity using the primary key.
```python
from app_name.models import Player
players = Player.objects.get(pk=2) # this method returns object
```
- ```ObjectDoesNotExist``` exception is raised if no entity found.

- To avoid raising an exception, use the filter method.

```python
from app_name.models import Player
players = Player.objects.filter(pk=2).first() # this method returns None if no entity found
```
